Paper Abstract: 

The conventional approach to optimising plasmonic sensors is typically based
entirely on ensuring phase matching between the excitation wave and the surface 
plasmon between two semi-infinite media. However, this leads to suboptimal 
performance, even in the conventional Otto geometry. We present a simplified 
coupled mode theory approach for evaluating and optimizing the sensing properties 
of plasmonic waveguide refractive index sensors. It only requires the calculation 
of propagation constants, without the need for calculating overlap integrals.  
We apply out method by evaluating the wavelength-, device length- and 
refractive index-dependent transmission spectra for an example silicon-on-insulator-based 
sensor of finite length. This reveals all salient spectral features which are 
consistent with full-field finite element calculations. This work provides a 
rapid and convenient framework for designing dielectric-plasmonic sensor prototypes.
